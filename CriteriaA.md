**Client's Design Statement**

In my pencil case, I have multiple pencils. At the moment I am struggling to pick what pencil I should use. In order to understand it. I need to know which pencil needs sharpening and when was the last time I used a pencil. Before all of this, I need a database so I can differentiate pencils from each other. Some of the different properties that are enough to separate these pencils are their brand, color, if it has a soft eraser on the back and the length if it's short or long (anything that 8 cm or less is short). I want all of these to be recorded and a system where it shows when I last used them and if they need sharpening. I would like an option to tick off the pencils I have sharpened. 
This can be seen in [appendix](Appendix.md) [1]

**Proposed Solution**


**Criteria for Success**
1. Pencil informations is able to be changed whenever, when user starts program it asks if the information is correct, if not then user will be able to input new information and it will be saved in the database
2. Show pencils available for use, will give option saying pencils available.
3. Show pencils needed to be sharpened, when user inputs a pencil name, The program is able to print whether it needs sharpening or not.

This has been discussed and agreed to with the client as shown in the [appendix](Appendix.md) [2]
