You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and Explain how they work as a system to create a computer.


**Processor (CPU)**

The CPU mainly does arithmetic and logical tasks. It will make a bunch of calculations to ensure the functions of the computer are carried out efficiently.


**CPU Cooler**

if a PC isn't cooled properly, it can overheat, causing costly damage to its components and circuitry. Fans are the most common device used to cool a PC. In addition, the CPU is covered by a metallic block called a heat sink, which draws heat away from the CPU. Some serious computer users, such as gamers, sometimes have more expensive heat management solutions, like a water-cooled system, designed to deal with more intense cooling demands.


**Motherboard**
 
basically a circuit board. It facilitates the communication of the other components in the computer. There are ports on the motherboard that face the outside of the computer, allowing you to plug in different components into your computer and also to charge it. It also allows you to scale up by including slots that allow for expansion. You could add in components like CPUs and RAMs, Video cards, and so on. You can also expand the motherboard by adding more ports that allow you to connect even more auxiliary devices to your computer. In other words, you have control over just what your computerâ€™s capabilities are.


**Graphics Card (GPU)**

A GPU is designed specifically for performing the complex mathematical and geometric calculations that are necessary for graphics rendering.


**Memory (RAM)**

temporary form of memory. When you open an application in our computer, the computer will place that application and all its data in the RAM. 


**Power Supply Unit (PSU)**

It ensures that every other component gets the "juice" that it needs to function properly


**Storage (HDD / SSD / NVME SSD)**

It is a permanent form of data storage, all three do pretty much the same, they store data for you. The main difference between the three is the speed.


**Monitor**

A computer monitor's function is to accurately and clearly display the programs, software or video being shown to the user. In more technical terms, a monitor is a video output device that displays text, video and other information. Prices vary depending on refresh rate and video defintion


**Keyboard**

A keyboard is used to enter characters and functions into the computer system by pressing buttons, or keys. It is the primary device used to enter text.


**Mouse**

A mouse is used to position a cursor on a computer screen. This allows the user to select items stored on a computer and, subsequently, perform actions on those items.
